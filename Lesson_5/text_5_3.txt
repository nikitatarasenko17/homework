The history of Spain dates back to the Antiquity when the pre-Roman peoples of the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian
Peninsula made contact with the Greeks and Phoenicians and the first writing systems known as Paleohispanic scripts
were developed. In 1516, Habsburg Spain unified a number of disparate predecessor kingdoms; its modern form of a
constitutional monarchy was introduced in 1813, and the current democratic constitution dates to 1978
